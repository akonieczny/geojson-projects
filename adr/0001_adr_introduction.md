# ADR - introduction

## Intro
This project used ADR (Architecture Decision Record) files to document architectural and design
 decisions. All important decisions should be described in ADR files for better understanding and
 for future developers.

## Format
The MD (Markdown) file format was chosen as the ADR file format due to its readability, convenience
 of use and popularity.

## Structure
The initial structure of the ADR documentation is presented below. It may change during work on the
 project, which should be properly documented.

```markdown
# Application server

## Problem
